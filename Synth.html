    <p>Synth</p>
    <p>A synthesizer, often shortened to "synth," is an electronic instrument that generates sound by creating and manipulating audio signals. Synths can produce a wide range of tones, from traditional musical notes to experimental and futuristic sounds. In a band, the synthesizer plays a versatile roleâ€”it can replicate other instruments, create unique textures, and add layers of ambiance or complexity to a song. Whether providing lush pads, intricate arpeggios, or cutting-edge effects, the synth pushes the boundaries of creativity and expands the band's sonic palette.</p>
