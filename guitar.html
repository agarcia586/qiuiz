    <p>Guitar</p>
    <p>A guitar is a stringed instrument typically played by strumming or plucking its six strings, which are stretched across a wooden body and neck. It comes in two main forms: acoustic and electric. In a band, the guitar often plays a dual roleâ€”providing rhythm to complement the percussion and bass, while also delivering melodic leads and solos to shape the song's character. The guitar is highly versatile, capable of creating harmony, texture, and expressive tones that can range from soft and soulful to powerful and electrifying, making it a cornerstone of modern music.</p>
