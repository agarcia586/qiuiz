    <p>Bass</p>
    <p>The bass is a stringed instrument, similar in appearance to a guitar but typically larger and tuned to lower frequencies. Played by plucking or slapping its thick strings, the bass provides the foundational groove and harmonic framework in a band. It bridges the rhythm and melody, working closely with the drums to anchor the tempo while complementing the guitar and vocals. The bass adds depth and richness to the music, emphasizing beats and transitions, and its distinctive low tones are essential for giving a band's sound its full-bodied character.</p>
