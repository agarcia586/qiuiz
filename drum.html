    <p>Drum</p>
    <P>A drum is a percussion instrument consisting of a hollow cylindrical shell with a membrane, or drumhead, stretched tightly across one or both ends. When struck with sticks, mallets, or hands, the drum produces sound through vibrations. In a band, drums serve as the backbone of rhythm and timing, creating the essential beat that other instruments and vocals build upon. They provide dynamic energy, drive, and structure, helping to set the tempo and mood of the music while uniting the ensemble's performance. Without drums, a band's sound often feels incomplete or lacking in rhythmic cohesion.</P>
